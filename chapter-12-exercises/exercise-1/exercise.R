# Load the `data/avocado.csv` file into a variable `avocados`
# Make sure strings are *not* read in as factors

# The file had some uninformative column names, so rename these columns:
# `X4046` to `small_haas`
# `X4225` to `large_haas`
# `X4770` to `xlarge_haas`

# In order to visualize this data, it needs to be reshaped. The four columns
# `other_avos`, `small_haas`, `large_haas`, `xlarge_haas` need to be 
# **gathered** together into a single column called `size`. The volume of sales
# (currently stored in each column) should be stored in a new column called 
# `volume`. Create a new dataframe `size_gathered` by passing the `by_size` 
# data frame to the `gather()` function. `size_gathered` will only have 3 
# columns: `Date`, `size`, and `volume`.

# We can also investigate sales by avocado type (conventional, organic).
# Create a new data frame `by_type` by grouping the `avocados` dataframe by
# `Date` and `type`, and calculating the sum of the `Total.Volume` for that type
# in that week (resulting in a data frame with 2 rows per week).

# Create a new data frame with only columns date, type, and volume.
by_type <- avocados %>% 
  group_by(Date, type) %>% 
  summarise(volume = sum(Total.Volume))


# To make a (visual) comparison of conventional versus organic sales, you 
# need to **spread** out the `type` column into two different columns. Create a 
# new data frame `by_type_wide` by passing the `by_type` data frame to 
# the `spread()` function!
by_type_wide <- by_type %>% 
  spread(key = type, value = volume)

# Now you can create a scatterplot comparing conventional to organic sales!
# (how to write this code is covered in Chapter 16)
